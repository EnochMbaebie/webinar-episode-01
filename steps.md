# Introduce our features

Our goal is to write a Smart Contract that stores a value that can be retrieve. To
do this we need to have the following.
  - [ ] a smart contract, `SimpleStorage`
  - [ ] some way to define the behavior of `SimpleStorage`
  - [ ] the ability to verify `SimpleStorage` behaves the way we defined

We will use aspects of Behavior driven development(BDD), and Test driven
development (TDD) methodologies to work through this tutorial. We will define
new behavior in truffle test files and implement contract logic to achieve that
behavior.

This approach allows us to examine our system in small testable pieces while
also increasing our knowledge and intuition of Truffle, Solidity and the
ecosystem.


## Behaviors

Let's create the truffle test-file for SimpleStorage, invoke truffle test, and
examine the output.

The prominent error below reveals SimpleStorage is missing in action!

``` sh
Error: Could not find artifacts for SimpleStorage from any sources
```

Truffle test mocks! It compiles and deploys the contracts we write to a local
test blockchain every time we run `truffle test`.  Our only behavior, the
expectation that `SimpleStorage` is deployed, fails because we have not yet
introduced this contract to our project.

> :exclamation: [Be sure to study the test code before proceeding](./test/simple_storage.js).


## SimpleStorage Contract

Now that we've defined some behavior of the SimpleStorage contract we want to
write.  Let's introduce it to our project and rerun the test.

``` sh
Error: SimpleStorage has not been deployed to detected network (network/artifact mismatch)
```

This error is informative. It tells us that `SimpleStorage` has not been
deployed to a network. Here's what `truffle test` does at a high level.
  - starts up a local test chain
  - compiles all contracts it knows about
  - deploys those contracts
  - calls all the tests in the system and displays the results

This is an incredibly useful feature Truffle does for us.  As Smart contract
developers, for the most part, we want to focus on implementing our contract
logic and not have to wrestle with complicated testchain business.

## Migration SimpleStorage

Truffle test will execute all the deployment scripts in lexical order. To
deploy our SimpleStorage contract we will write a migration script.

> filenames.

Create the the SimpleStorage deployment `migrations/2_deploy_simple_storage.js`
and then execute another test

``` Solidity
const SimpleStorage = artifacts.require("SimpleStorage");

module.exports = function(deployer) {
  deployer.deploy(SimpleStorage);
}
```

Execute Truffle test

``` sh
$ truffle test

Contratulations! If you see a similar output then you have:
  - [x] a smart contract, `SimpleStorage`
  - [x] a way to define the behavior of `SimpleStorage`
  - [x] a way to validate its behavior is correct

# Behavior: Our business logic

The SimpleStorage contract should have:
  - [ ] a state, `storedData`. This is the location to store an integer value
  - [ ] its `storedData` value at deployment be zero
  - [ ] a function `getStoredData`, to retrieve the current `storedData` value.
  - [ ] a function `setStoredData`, to set the `storedData` value.


## define initial deployment value of storedData

Add the following code to the test file and execute truffle test.

``` JavaScript
contract("SimpleStorage", (/* accounts */) => {
  describe("Initial deployment", async () => {
    it("should assert true", async function () {
      await SimpleStorage.deployed();
      assert.isTrue(true);
    });

    it("was deployed and it's intial value is 0", async () => {
      // get subject
      const ssInstance = await SimpleStorage.deployed();
      // verify it starts with zero
      const storedData = await ssInstance.getStoredData.call();
      assert.equal(storedData, 0, `Initial state should be zero`);
    });
  });
});

```

## test: watch it fail

Since we defined a new behavior we expect the test to fail. Lets see how the
system reports this expected failure.

## implement getStoredData

update SimpleStorage.sol to
  - declare a public uint256 named storedData
  - add a public view named getStoredData that returns the contract's state storedData

``` Solidity
contract SimpleStorage {
  uint256 public storedData;

  function getStoredData() public view returns (uint256) {
    return storedData;
  }

}

:tada: SimpleStorage has:

  - [x] a state, `storedData`. This is the location to store an integer value
  - [x] its `storedData` value at deployment be zero
  - [x] a function `getStoredData`, to retrieve the current `storedData` value.
  - [ ] a function `setStoredData`, to set the `storedData` value.

> :question:Something to ponder for later: we didn't initialze the state, yet its initial

## define setStoredData behavior

There's one bit of feature missing. Lets implement!
  - [ ] a function `setStoredData`, to set the `storedData` value.

Add the following describe block to our the test and run truffle test.

``` javascript
describe("Functionality", () => {
 it("should store the value 42", async () => {
   // get subject
   const ssInstance = await SimpleStorage.deployed();

   // change the subject
   await ssInstance.setStoredData(42, { from: accounts[0] });

   // verify we changed the subject
   const storedData = await ssInstance.getStoredData.call();
   assert.equal(storedData, 42, `${storedData} was not stored!`);
   });
 });

```

Let's make sure we have accounts in our tests.  Uncomment `accounts` so test
entry point reads as:

``` javascript
  contract("SimpleStorage", function (accounts) {
```

Run truffle test

## implement setStoredData

The following line in the output indicates that `setStoredData` is not a
function. We should fix that.

```
  TypeError: ssInstance.setStoredData is not a function
```

Add the following function to the SimpleStorage contract

``` solidity
function setStoredData(uint256 x) public {
  storedData = x;
}
```
